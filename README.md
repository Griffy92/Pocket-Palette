## üìÑ General Info
Pocket Palette is a web-based application that offers a platform for exploring artistic concepts like painting, pixel drawing, and Etch A Canvas. With a focus on user interactions and practical artistic expression, Pocket Palette enables users to effortlessly unleash their creativity by creating, drawing, and manipulating shapes, lines, and a diverse palette of colors on a virtual canvas. By utilizing modern web technologies, such as Supabase and JavaScript frameworks like React, Pocket Palette delivers an immersive and feature-rich drawing experience.

This project, led by Dom, Karen, Riley, Roxanne, and Stuart, is a collaborative effort representing our third undertaking within the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. With the aim of embracing a challenging endeavor that elevates our skills and knowledge in web development, our diverse team, spanning three different time zones, effectively collaborates to ensure continuous progress on the project.
